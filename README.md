# Block_Snapchat_Ads
This repo was created by me, and probably won't be well maintained. Feel free to subscribe to the list within Pihole, or use the domains on the list as a starting point for your own implementation. 

This was tested on a Google Pixel 5. There are no obvious issues that I have discovered. I'm still able to send/receive snaps, and notifications are working fine. I'm located on the East Coast so I've whitelisted a few East Coast servers. Depending on your geography, you may have to add more to this list. 

Please let me know of any issues and I'll do my best to implement the changes in a timely manner.
