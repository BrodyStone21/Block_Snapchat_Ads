## Block_Snapchat_Ads
A domain list created to block ads within Snapchat through Pi-hole. Feel free to follow the below steps to add the list to your installation, or use the domains on the list as a starting point for your own list.

This was tested on a Google Pixel 5. There are no obvious issues I've discovered. I'm still able to send/receive snaps, and notifications are working fine. I'm located on the East Coast so I've whitelisted a few East Coast servers. Depending on your geography, you may have to add more to this list. 

Please let me know of any issues and I'll do my best to implement the changes in a timely manner.

### How to add to Pi-hole
Pi-hole Web UI -> "Group Management" -> "Adlists" -> Address: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrodyStone21/Block_Snapchat_Ads/main/domains/whitelist.txt
